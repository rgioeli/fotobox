# fotobox
A social media platform to share media bundles with each other.

**What This App Does**
The purpose of this application is allow users to upload to the same photo box (or storage) - for everyone who has access to that box to view. 
Users are also allowed to create their own boxes (albums really) and share them in a bundle.

The real highlight of this app is for users who were (lets say) at the same event - to be able to upload to the same box for others who were at that event to see. Think of it as a collage that all allowed users can contribute to and view.
